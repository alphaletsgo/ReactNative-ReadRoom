# React-Native 采坑篇
### Application * has not been registered.
错误描述：
```sh
Loading dependency graph...npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 11
npm ERR! smp001@0.0.1 start: `node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start`
npm ERR! Exit status 11
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Failed at the smp001@0.0.1 start script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.
```
遇到这种问题首先怀疑端口被占用问题，首先使用`sudo lsof -i :8081` 检查8081端口，查看有没有被占用，如果发现被占用可以使用`kill -9`
Run the following command to find id of the process which is using port 8081
sudo lsof -i :8081
Then run the following to terminate process:
kill -9 23583


`ps aux | grep react-native`
